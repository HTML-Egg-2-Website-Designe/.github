## ℹ️ About HTML Egg 2 (Expanded)

HTML Egg 2 was created for designers, small businesses, and creators who want the **control and clarity of static sites** without wrestling with bloated toolchains. Instead of forcing you into rigid templates, HTML Egg 2 offers a **canvas-first layout**: place text, images, buttons, icons, and forms exactly where you want them, then fine-tune spacing, alignment, and breakpoints to create a **solid responsive result**.

Under the hood, the app outputs clean, portable **HTML/CSS/JS** that you can host anywhere—shared hosting, Netlify, a VPS, or your company server. This means faster pages, fewer moving parts, and simpler maintenance. Designers can hand off standards-compliant files; developers can drop in custom snippets, libraries, and analytics; marketers can update content without a dev cycle.

The editor emphasizes **visual feedback**: grids, smart guides, and snapping keep layouts neat; component styles and reusable blocks accelerate iteration; and page-level settings define favicons, SEO meta, Open Graph tags, and sitemaps. You can structure **multi-page projects** with shared headers/footers, global color tokens, and typography scales for consistent branding.

Publishing is straightforward. Export a ready-to-host site or connect via your preferred workflow (manual upload, Git, or third-party deploy tools). Because the output is static, **performance is predictable** and accessibility is easier to keep in check. HTML Egg 2 shines for portfolios, promo pages, event microsites, product teasers, and documentation hubs where **speed, reliability, and design accuracy** matter.

Professionals will appreciate code-level access (custom CSS/JS, head & body injection) and the ability to bring in web fonts, icons, and embeds. Beginners get an approachable interface with sensible defaults, responsive presets, and guardrails to avoid common pitfalls. Optimized for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs, the editor remains responsive on large projects, making **designing, previewing, and shipping** a smooth loop.
